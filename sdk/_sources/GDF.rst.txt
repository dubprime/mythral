Mythral Data Format (GDF)
=======================

The data entry format for use with the Mythral Framework is called Mythral Data Format (GDF).
GDFs have several fields that correspond to different types of data:

.. code-block:: python

    gdf = \
        {'strings' : [],
         'vectors': [],
         'emotives': [],
         'metadata': {},
         'path': []
        }

Fields
++++++

The following section briefly explain the different fields present in a GDF

strings
-------

The strings field is used to observe data that is already symbolic (in string format) on a Mythral Agent.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python
        
        gdf['strings'] = ['temperature|54', 'UV_INDEX|HIGH', 'weather|sunny', 'time|afternoon']

vectors
-------

The vectors field is used to observe numeric data on a Mythral Agent. For example, 
this field may be used for flattened image data, mathmatical data, etc.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        # image loaded previously into Python
        flattened_image_data = image.flatten()
        gdf['vectors'] = [flattened_image_data]

emotives
--------

The emotives field is used to provide emotional data about an observation to the Mythral agent.

metadata
--------

The metadata field is used to pass through additional data about an observation that will not impact the predicting of a Cognitive Processor

path
----

The path field is used internally to show the path taken by an observation as it travels through a Mythral agent's topology

Example Conversions
+++++++++++++++++++

To illustrate the process of converting data into GDF format, here are some specific examples 
corresponding to potential use-cases.

CSV to GDF
----------

CSV Data can be rapidly converted into GDF format by utilizing the strings field of the GDF. 
Each row corresponds to a single data record, from which an individual GDF will be created.
The headers, and the individual data elements from each row can be concatenated to make feature
strings for each entry. For example, if a header value is "name", and a specific data value is "Steve",
a feature string for the GDF would be "name|Steve".

Here is a more comprehensive example:

.. list-table:: Example HR CSV
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Name
        - Age
        - Sex
        - Salary
    *   - Steve
        - 34
        - male
        - 50000
    *   - Josh
        - 25
        - male
        - 65000
    *   - Gregory
        - 52
        - male
        - 43000

.. list-table:: Corresponding GDF Conversions
    :widths: 60 20 20
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Strings
        - Vectors
        - Emotives
    *   - :code:`"Name|Steve", "Age|34", "Sex|male", "Salary|50000"`
        - 
        - 
    *   - :code:`"Name|Josh", "Age|25", "Sex|male", "Salary|65000"`
        - 
        - 
    *   - :code:`"Name|Gregory", "Age|52", "Sex|male", "Salary|43000"`
        - 
        -
