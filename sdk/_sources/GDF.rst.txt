GAIuS Data Format (GDF)
=======================

The data entry format for use with the GAIuS Framework is called GAIuS Data Format (GDF).
GDFs have several fields that correspond to different types of data:

.. code-block:: python

    gdf = \
        {'strings' : [],
         'vectors': [],
         'emotives': [],
         'metadata': {},
         'path': []
        }

Fields
++++++

The following section briefly explain the different fields present in a GDF

strings
-------

The strings field is used to observe data that is already symbolic (in string format) on a GAIuS Agent.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python
        
        gdf['strings'] = ['temperature|54', 'UV_INDEX|HIGH', 'weather|sunny', 'time|afternoon']

vectors
-------

The vectors field is used to observe numeric data on a GAIuS Agent. For example, 
this field may be used for flattened image data, mathmatical data, etc.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        # image loaded previously into Python
        flattened_image_data = image.flatten()
        gdf['vectors'] = [flattened_image_data]

emotives
--------

The emotives field is used to provide emotional data about an observation to the GAIuS agent.

metadata
--------

The metadata field is used to pass through additional data about an observation that will not impact the predicting of a Cognitive Processor

path
----

The path field is used internally to show the path taken by an observation as it travels through a GAIuS agent's topology
